			<li>Initial Server Setup 1/14/14</li>
			<div style="padding-left:15px">
			Initial server setup went great. We have 4 servers three of which are running debian and one of which is running gentoo (gentoo master race). We have also decided to name all servers after starships. Our current servers are Enterprise, Mothership, Slave01 and Starbug. During this server setup we also had to set up a cisco switch, giving us experience with the cisco console switch setup interface.

			<li>IRC and Wiki Setup 2/7/14</li>
			<div style="padding-left:15px">
				Because of the software packages that were available the install went very smoothly and no hiccups occured. Most of us had already done a similar setup before so not much learning occured from this event.
